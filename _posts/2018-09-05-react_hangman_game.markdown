I recently built a little word guessing game in React. The app pulls data (a list of words) from an API, randomly selects a word from the list, and allows the user six guesses to guess the word.

The plan is to further develop this game, and first up would be to add a feature that draws the hangman when the user's guess is incorrect.

I'm having a lot of fun with this one. Check out the [Github repo](https://github.com/aut0maat10/hangman) if you're interested.
