I like to learn new things every day. That is why I decided to go back to college in my mid-20s, after many years of working as a professional musician and guitar teacher. A few years later, I graduated with a B.A. in English, and since then, I have been moving around -- from Helsinki, Finland to Vienna, Austria, and finally landed in New York City a few years ago. 

My interest in computer programming was sparked some years ago when I needed a website for a new music project. I decided to make one myself, and with the help of a web developer friend, I read a few books on HTML and CSS, watched some YouTube tutorials, and learned how to set up and manipulate basic Wordpress themes and templates. Back then, just moving elements around and changing background colors and fonts in the browser felt like magic, and I quickly realized that I needed to learn more.

I tried to tackle JavaScript through online resources, and learned some basic syntax, but it felt like the big picture of building things was missing. Since I was still working as a musician, I usually had a lot of free time during the day, so I decided to commit to learning how to code on a full-time basis. 

Some very helpful online resources and forums led me to Harvard's introduction to computer sciences, CS50x on edX. The course was a real challenge, and at times very frustrating, like when you spend long, late nights looking for that one tiny bug that makes your program crash (only to find, hours later, that it was a missing semicolon). At the same time, working through these problems made me realize that programming is the one thing besides music that I really enjoy. After completing CS50, I knew I wanted to be a programmer, and I have have been purposefully working towards that goal ever since.

It is the problem solving aspect of programming that I like the best. No matter how small or simple the program, the feeling when it (finally) works according to your expectations is pretty hard to beat. In my mind, programming is not that different from learning an instrument either: When you first pick up a new instrument, you have to spend some time to learn the basics, like how to hold a guitar, place your fingers correctly on the piano keyboard in order to play a chord - or the basic syntax of the notes on your fretboard, if you will. When you know how to play a few simple chords, scales, and song (hopefully without your fingers hurting) you can slowly start thinking of big picture stuff, such as tone, song structure, advanced technique, etc., and find and learn to understand the connection between the abstract (music theory) and the actual notes and chords you play. 

When it comes to programming, I am definitely still practicing my first few beginner riffs and songs, but the big picture stuff is slowly starting to open up. Just like with learning to play the guitar, I know that in order to develop your skills, you just have to put in the hours and practice, practice, practice. And just like with music you never stop learning, which is the only way I want it!
